When i was young i'd listen to the radiowaiting for my favorite songsWhen they played i'd sing along,it made me smile.Those were such happy times and not so long agohow i wondered where they'd gone.But they're back again just like a long lost friendall the songs i love so well.Every shalala every wo'wostill shines.Every shing-a-ling-a-lingthat they're startingto sing so fineWhen they get to the partWhere he's breaking her heartIt can really make me cryjust like before.It's yesterday once more.(shoobie do lang lang)Looking back on how it was in years gone byand the good times that I hadmakes today seem rather sad,so much has changed.It was songs of love that i would sing to themand i'd memorise each word.Those old melodies still sound so good to meas they melt the years awayevery shalala every wo'wo still shinesevery shing-a-ling-a-lingthat they're startingto singso fineall my best memorise come back clearly to meSome can even make me cryjust like before.It's yesterday once more.(shoobie do lang lang)Every shalala every wo'wo still shines.Every shing-a-ling-a-lingthat they're starting to singso fineEvery shalala every wo'wo still shines.
